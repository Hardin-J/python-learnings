## 💻 How to Use This Repository

### **For Complete Beginners:**
1. Start with `day01_basics/01_input_output.py`
2. Read the code line by line
3. Run the program
4. Modify the code to understand how it works
5. Try the corresponding exercises in `practice/`
6. Progress sequentially through all topics

### **For Practice:**
1. Open an exercise file in `practice/` folder
2. Try to solve it WITHOUT looking at other solutions first
3. Test your solution
4. Compare with any reference solutions
5. Learn from differences

### **For Review:**
1. Go back to concept files (e.g., `01_input_output.py`)
2. Review key concepts and syntax
3. Run the examples
4. Revisit difficult practice exercises

---

## 🎓 Learning Approach

### **Best Practices:**
1. **Type It Out** - Don't copy-paste; type the code yourself
2. **Experiment** - Modify examples and see what breaks
3. **Debug** - Use print() to understand program flow
4. **Comment** - Add notes to your code explaining it
5. **Practice Daily** - Consistency beats intensity
6. **Build Projects** - Apply concepts to real problems

### **Time Estimate:**
- **Day 1 Topics:** 5-7 hours (including exercises)
- **Per Exercise:** 15-30 minutes
- **Mini Projects:** 1-2 hours each

---

## 📋 Exercise Structure

Each exercise file in the `practice/` folder is numbered as `Exercise_X.Y.py` where:
- **X** = Topic number (1-10)
- **Y** = Exercise number within that topic (1-2)

### **Example Exercises:**
- **Exercise_1.1.py**: User Profile Card (Input/Output)
- **Exercise_2.1.py**: Type Inspector (Data Types)
- **Exercise_3.1.py**: AI Dataset Eligibility (Conditions)
- **Exercise_4.1.py**: Sum of N Numbers (Loops)
- ... and so on

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- **Python 3.6+** (3.8+ recommended)
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
- Terminal/Command Prompt
- No external packages needed for Day 1

### **Check Your Python Version:**
```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```

- Detailed explanations of each concept
- Working examples
- Comments explaining each part
- Good for learning and reference

### **Practice Exercises** (`practice/Exercise_X.Y.py`)
- Real-world inspired challenges
- Require applying learned concepts

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

**1. "ModuleNotFoundError" when running a file**
- Make sure you're in the correct directory
- Use absolute paths or navigate to the file's directory

**2. "Invalid syntax" error**
- Check for missing colons (`:`) at the end of if/for/while/def statements
- Check indentation (Python uses 4 spaces)
- Check for matching parentheses and quotes

**3. "input() seems to hang"**
- The program is waiting for your input
- Type something and press Enter

**4. File not found errors**
- Check the file path
- Make sure you're running from the correct directory
